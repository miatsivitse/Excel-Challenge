Module 1 Challenge: Crowdfunding Report


Data Set Conclusions

Three conclusions we can draw about the crowdfunding campaign include:

The breakdown of campaign outcome (success, failure or cancellation) by category shows us that most campaigns succeeded, rather than failed. In fact, 56.5% of campaigns succeeded compared to 36.4% of those campaigns that failed. From this breakdown, we found that crowdfunding campaigns in the theater parent category had the highest total number of campaigns, and 54.3% of those theater campaigns were successful, compared to 38.3% that failed. 

The breakdown of campaign outcome (success, failure or cancellation) by subcategory provided insight that crowdfunding campaigns under the subcategory of plays were most popular, making up 34.4% of all crowdfunding campaigns. Since this category falls under the theater campaign described above, we saw a parallel in total percentage breakdown of campaign successes versus failures with 54.3% of campaigns with the subcategory “plays” considered successful in their pledged goal, versus 38.3% that failed. In comparison, subcategories such as world music and audio were far less popular, with three and four total crowdfunding campaigns, respectively.  These campaigns (both audio and world music) both saw 100% success rates on their pledge goals.

The breakdown of campaign outcome (success, failure or cancellation) by month provided visibility into the months of the year that garnered a higher total of successful campaigns as well as higher totals of failed campaigns. For example, we can infer from the data set that not only did July have the highest total crowdfunding campaigns during the year, but July also had the highest total count of successful campaigns at a total of 58, making up 62.3% of the total campaigns in July. In comparison, January had the highest total of failed campaigns during the year for a total of 36, making up 39.5% of all campaigns during January.

Data Set Limitations

Limitations of this data set include the lack of visibility on the specific donation amounts on each Crowdfunding project. Additionally, the data set lacks visibility on the donor names for each project. Both of these considerations would provide insight and clarity on which donors donated to multiple crowdfunding campaigns, and if there were any trends in donation amounts by donor, such as category or subcategory. Trends around donor behavior could be informative for forecasting which projects could potentially receive large donations. Further, specific donations amounts could provide further clarity on the data set, allowing us to describe the variability of the data set using variance, standard deviation, and z-score. These indicators of variability could help us determine values that best describe the data, how much variation exists, and how spread out the data is from the mean.

Other Data Comparisons to Consider and Their Value

Other possible tables and graphs we could create would include:

	
•	Average Donation by Parent Category
•	Average Donation by Subcategory
•	Average Donation by Country
•	Average Donation by Campaign Outcome 

The value that the other tables and graphs provide would be to understand the relationship between average donations and other variables such as the Category / Subcategory, country, or campaign outcome for the purpose of seeing which crowdfunding campaigns based on these variables received higher average donations. By analyzing the data between these variables, we may be able to locate indicators to predict crowdfunding campaign outcomes. 

Bonus Statistical Analysis:

For successful outcomes, the median best summarizes this data set. There are a high amount of values that are outliers in this data set as they fall outside of the boundaries. Due to a high number of outliers, the mean creates a skew in the data and therefore is not the best representative of all data values. Additionally, the variance is high, indicating that the values in the data set are far from the mean. The standard deviation being high is also a great indicator that the values are spread far from the mean.

Similar to the successful outcomes, the median best summarizes the failed outcomes data set. There are a high amount of values that are outliers in this data set as they fall outside of the boundaries. Due to a high number of outliers, the mean creates a skew in the data and therefore is not the best representative of all data values. The variance is high, indicating that the values in the data set are far from the mean. Finally, the standard deviation also being high indicates that the values are spread far from the mean.
